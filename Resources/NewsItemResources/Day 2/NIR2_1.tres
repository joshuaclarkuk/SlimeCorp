ItemTitle = "Five-Eyed Mayor Calls for Calm"
ItemBody = "Following the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new [REDACTED] facility, local authorities assure residents that the rising reports of night terrors, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations of writhing tentacles are unrelated. According to the town’s mayor, who has recently grown several additional eyes, the facility is a marvel of modern science. He also added that the constant low hum emanating from the facility is simply “the sound of efficiency.”

While some locals have taken to wearing foil hats and muttering about unseen horrors, the mayor insists that there's no need for alarm. After all, where would we be without progress? Certainly not in the warm, pulsating grip of a benevolent ancient entity slowly wrapping its tendrils around our very souls"
