ItemTitle = "Work Event from HR"
ItemBody = "To all employees,

We’ll be hosting a mandatory team-building event on the last Friday of next month in Non-Euclidean Seminar Room C (the small door at the northern end of Sub-Basement Level 7). Please remember your work-issued flashlights (“F” to activate) and attach a long piece of string to the door as you enter. As those of you that returned from the last one will know: it can be a little tricky to find your way back to the exit.

The event will feature activities designed to promote trust, collaboration, and a strong resistance to psychological distress.

Snacks and drinks will be provided, though it’s important not to look directly at any of the offerings before consumption. 

Looking forward to seeing everyone there—together we are stronger (and more resilient to the whispers)."
