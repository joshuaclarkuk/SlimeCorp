ItemBody = "Dear reader,

Locked yourself out of the house? Fear not! There are only TWO tools you’ll need to find a way back in: a screwdriver, and a hammer!

Unscrew the troublesome handle with the screwdriver and, once removed, insert the end of the screwdriver into the square hollow and twist!

And if all else fails, there’s always the hammer. A little BRUTE FORCE never hurts as a LAST resort."
